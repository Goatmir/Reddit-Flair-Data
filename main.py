# This script gets X amount of posts in a subreddits Hot, It then gets their flair
# It gets how many times each flair appeared (for all submissions)
# Then it displays a pie chart for what percentage of the posts had each flair
# if something is double quoted in comments "like this" then it is an object
# Extension files needed:
# secrets.json  -  Contains client_id and client_secret of reddit application
